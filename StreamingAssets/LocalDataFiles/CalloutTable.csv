Darwin,2: The Region,1,Darwin,[none],"The coastal capital city of the Northern Territory, Darwin, serves as the Top End's regional centre. [newline][newline]The Larrakia People are the Traditional Owners of the Greater Darwin Region (Garramilla). This region is known for its tropical climate with a distinct wet (beginning late November) and dry season (beginning around May)."
Katherine,2: The Region,2,Katherine,[none],"Katherine is situated on the Katherine River, 320 km southeast of Darwin. [newline][newline]The town is the fourth-largest settlement in the Territory, and has become known as the place where \""The outback meets the tropics\"". Katherine had an urban population of approximately 9,643 at the 2021 Census."
Mataranka,2: The Region,3,Mataranka and Thermal Pools,[none],"Mataranka is a township 107 km south of Katherine, with a population of 384 at the 2021 Census. [newline][newline]Mataranka is known for the Elsey National Park thermal springs. The crystal clear pools that are fed by the springs are at temperatures between 30 and 40+ degrees. "
Larrimah,2: The Region,4,Larrimah,[none],"Larrimah is a small town located 431 km southeast of Darwin on the Stuart Highway. At the 2021 Census, Larrimah had a population of 27."
DalyWaters,2: The Region,5,Daly Waters,[none],The small settlement of Daly Waters is 620 km south of Darwin at the intersection of the Carpentaria highway and the Stuart highway. The 2021 Census recorded a population of 55.
Elliot,2: The Region,6,Elliot,[none],"Elliot is located halfway between Darwin and Alice Springs on the Stuart highway, 250 km north of Tennant creek. Elliot had a population of 287 at the 2021 Census."
Jilkminggan,2: The Region,7,Jilkminggan,[none],Jilkminggan is a closed Indigenous community 146 km southeast of Katherine. At the 2021 Census the population was 254.
LakeWoods,2: The Region,8,Lake Woods,[none],"Lake Woods is a freshwater lake located 7km from Elliot. It consists of a large ephemeral wetland on the western edge of the Barkly Tableland. It covers 350 sq km and, at times, can host over 10,000 waterbirds."
RoperRiver,2: The Region,9,Roper River,[none],"The Roper River is a large perennial river located to the north of the Beetaloo Sub-basin in the Katherine region of the Northern Territory. [newline][newline]The Roper River rises east of Mataranka in the Elsey National Park and flows generally east for over 1,000 km to meet the sea in Limmen Bight on the Gulf of Carpentaria. The river descends 126 metres over its 1,010-km course and has a catchment area of 81,794 sq km."
BeetalooGeology,3: Geology,1,Geography,[none],"The Beetaloo Sub-basin lies about 500 km southeast of Darwin in the Northern Territory, between Mataranka to the north and Elliott to the south. It spans an area of about 28,000 sq km. [newline][newline]The Beetaloo Sub-basin is a structural component of the greater McArthur Basin, which covers a range of sedimentary rock formations that extend from the northern part of the NT to northeast of WA and across to northwest Qld."
MacArthurBasin,3: Geology,2,McArthur Basin,[none],"The McArthur Basin is an extensive sedimentary basin that covers much (about 180,000 sq km) of the northern part of the Northern Territory. [newline][newline]The Paleoproterozoic sedimentary layers in the McArthur Basin were deposited between 2,500 and 1,600 million years ago. These geological layers formed from sediments that were deposited in ancient seas and rivers."
BeetalooSub-Basin,3: Geology,3,Beetaloo Sub-basin,[none],"The Beetaloo Sub-basin consists of Mesoproterozoic Roper Group sediments, more than 5,000 m thick, that were deposited over 1000 million years ago. [newline][newline]The Beetaloo Sub-basin is divided into eastern and western elements. The overlying sedimentary basins include 3 hydrogeological basins; the Neoproterozoic to Paleozoic Georgina, Wiso and Daly basins; and the Mesozoic Carpentaria Basin. [newline][newline]The Beetaloo Sub-basin is made up of many geological and hydrogeological layers. This 3D model shows 8 major layers, from the surface to almost 4 km beneath the ground."

KyallaFormation,4: Deep Dive,5,Kyalla Formation,[none],The Kyalla Formation is poorly exposed in the Urapunga region to the north of the Beetaloo Sub-basin. It is intersected by the majority of wells in the Beetaloo GBA region and it has a maximum thickness of 786 m. Includes interbedded siltstone and claystone.

CambrianFormation,4: Deep Dive,2,Cambrian Formation,[none],"This deposit is believed to have been formed via the influx of an oxidised metal-bearing fluid into a pre-existing, zoned hydrocarbon reservoir, leading to the deposition of base metals by thermochemical sulfate reduction.
